"""Domain table for multilingual conversation generation.

Each domain defines its conversation shape (`pair` = 2-persona advisory,
matching conversation.rs's engine; `group` = 4-persona, matching
group_conversation.rs's engine), whether it's region-sensitive (uses the
language's region/place/staple/currency/regulator facts from languages.py),
its roles with system-prompt templates, and the variation axes
(topic templates, issues, modifiers) the generator samples from to produce
many distinct specs without needing a model call per spec.

Placeholders available in `role_descs`/`topic_templates`: {issue},
{modifier}, {name0}..{name3}, and — region-sensitive domains only —
{place}, {staple}, {currency}, {regulator}, {region}.
